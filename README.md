continuity.js
=============

A library for interacting with [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/)'s [Unity Web API](http://developer.ubuntu.com/api/ubuntu-12.04/javascript/unity-web-api-reference.html).

This is something I made while playing around with their documentation.  It is also early in development, but please **star** (or make a pull request) if you're interested.

That said, I hope it's useful to you.  :)

Requirements
------------

* Ubuntu 12.10 or above (not yet out of beta as of 2012.10.10)

Example
-------

See `application.js` for a simple example.
